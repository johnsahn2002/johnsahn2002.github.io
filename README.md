## 🧑‍💻 Getting Started

To run the site locally:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/johnsahn2002/johnsahn2002.github.io.git
cd johnsahn2002.github.io
```

2. Install dependencies:

## 📦 Build for Production

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will output the production-ready files to the `build/` directory.

---

## 📤 Deployment

To redeploy after making changes:

1. Commit your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update site"
```

2. Push to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin main
```

GitHub Pages will automatically deploy the latest version from the `main` branch (or from the `gh-pages` branch if configured).

If using a custom domain, configure your DNS settings and set your domain name under **Repository → Settings → Pages**.
